The [sleep cicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_cycle) is an oscillation between the slow-wave and REM (paradoxical) phases of sleep. It is sometimes called the ultradian sleep cycle, sleepâ€“dream cycle, or REM-NREM cycle, to distinguish it from the circadian alternation between sleep and wakefulness.

We have two types of sleep charts:
* Stages
* Classic
